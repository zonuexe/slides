   I hate all “religious wars”.  In particular, it is worthless about technical matters.
   - *Windows* vs *UNIX*
   - *Tab* vs *Space*
   - *Statically typed* vs *Dynamic typing*
   - /...and,/ *Emacs* vs *Vim*
   There is no absolute difference between these superiorities.  Ridiculating other people 's hobbies is not professional behavior.
** I recommend PhpStorm IDE for PHP Newbies
   - It is almost unnecessary to “customize the editor”.
   - It warns us a lot of anxiety for PHP.
   - However, in our company, members choose Text Editor/IDE at their discretion.
     - **Vim**, **Visual Studio Code**, and **PhpStorm**... etc.

** About PHP

   - As many of you know, it's a popular development environment for the Web.
   - It is probably easiest to deploy web applications among the technologies known today.
     - PHP is the successor to CGI, but you can choose an architecture with less performance penalty.
   - Small web sites, many CMS (WordPress, Drupal, etc.), large-scale SNS are made up of PHP.
   - Looking at PHP as a programming language, it is classified as "weak dynamic typing".
     - PHP is procedural, but at the same time it has OOP feature.
     - Several frameworks are based on object-oriented design.
   - PHP is also a general purpose scripting language and can be used from the CLI.
** Development environment for PHP
   - Just put the file on the server, the PHP application will be published to Web.
     - Even with traditional cheap web hosting transferring with FTP it still works
   - *CGI*, *Apache module*, *FastCGI*... There are various server types.
   - In Web programming it is not always execution on a coding PC.
     - Many PHP in production environment runs on *GNU/Linux*.
     - Many PHP programmers' PCs are *Windows* or *macOS*.
** Development environment for PHP
   - It has been considered that IDE for PHP is unnecessary until now.
     - That is true even now.
   - There have already been several IDEs for PHP.
     - Eclipse(PDT), NetBeans, Zend Studio...
   - In my personal experience, none of the people recommended IDE to me.
     - Many colleagues used *Vim*, *Emacs*, and *Sublime Text 2*.
     - Since we were logging in to the shared server with SSH, there were many people who emphasized editing on the text terminal.
       - It took two choices between Vim and Emacs *Vim* and *Emacs*.
* PhpStorm
